# Spark_Scala

This repo contains code samples in Scala for dealing with Apache Spark's APIs.

This project contains snippets of Scala code for illustrating various Apache Spark concepts. It is intended to help you get started with learning Apache Spark (as a Scala programmer) by providing a super easy on-ramp that doesn't involve Unix, cluster configuration, building from sources or installing Hadoop. Many of these activities will be necessary later in your learning experience, after you've used these examples to achieve basic familiarity.
